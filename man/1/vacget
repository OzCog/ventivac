.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vacget
retrieves a venti archive from a venti server to the current working directory.
.PP
.I Vacput
writes a venti archive to a venti server.  The
.I paths
are walked recursively and all files and directories written to the archive.  Temporary files, i.e. those with the
.B DMTMP
bit set, are skipped.  With
.B -d
a base archive can be specified.  Files that have not changed are assumed to be present in venti and included in the new archive without writing their contents to venti.  Specify
.B -q
to allow vacput to only write new data in append-only files to venti.
.TP
.BI -d " vacfile"
The score in
.I vacfile
is used as base archive while writing.  Only the contents of files that have been modified are written to venti before inclusion in the new archive.  Only for vacput.
.TP
.B -q
Use heuristics (append-only mode, qid path, qid version, modification time and file size) to determine whether a part of the file is already in venti and does not have to be written again.  Only for vacput and in conjunction with
.BR -d .
.TP
.B -D
Print debug messages.
.TP
.B -p
Try to preserve file permissions and owner/group.  Only for vacget.
.TP
.B -v
Be verbose.  Prints file names to standard error as they are being retrieved or written.  Vacput also writes the number of bytes and blocks written and read.
.TP
.B -t
List files, do not write them.  Only for vacget.
.TP
.B -r
Do not use fixed sized blocks, for use Rabin fingerprinting for determining block boundaries.  Only for vacput.
.TP
.BI -a " address"
Dial
.I address
instead of the default venti server.
.TP
.BI -b " blocksize"
Use blocks with
.I blocksize
bytes instead of the default 8192 byte blocks.  Only for vacput.
.TP
.BI -n " name"
Use
.I name
as the name in the root block.  Only for vacput.

The vac data structures used to write archives with variable block sizes may change.
